## Introduction

SEFI is a framework for evaluating the robustness of deep learning-based image recognition models.

It uses selected attack methods to generate adversarial samples based on selected models and uses these adversarial examples to attack any model you want. In the process, it collects data including multiple evaluation metrics to assess AI model robustness and attack method effectiveness while trying to find the best defense solution.

It also provides a toolkit containing multiple models, SOTA attack methods and defense methods, and allows users to make additional integrations themselves.

SEFI was created and is maintained by researchers at BIT.

## Functions

### What models do we support？

We have supported 15 models on 4 datasets, of which all 15 models for the ImageNet dataset are available. We hope that you will participate in improving our model library and share your own model structure and weighting information to help more people.

We have built a public repository of model weights(SEFI-LW) located: https://github.com/NeoSunJZ/Canary_SEFI_Lib_Weight

We are looking for more good and classic attack methods to add to our library, if you are the author of a method, feel free to contribute your method. Some of the methods that are not fully tested may not be shown in the above table, but it may appear in the code earlier, if it fails to appear in the above list it means it may not be stable or have stable support for the time being.

### What defense methods do we support? (Experimental)

**The entire defense module is currently experimental, which means they may not be stable.**

We support 8 common defense methods, including:
